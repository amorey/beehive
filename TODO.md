# TODO

Deferred work, with the reasoning that led to deferring it. An item earns a place
here when it is a real defect or gap that we chose *not* to fix yet — not a
wishlist. Each one records what would make it worth doing, so the next reader can
tell "we decided against this for now" from "nobody thought of it."

No open items.

## Resolved

- **Post-commit hook on the `Store` interface** — done.
  `Store.AfterCommit(ctx, fn)` buffers `fn` on the transaction-scoped
  `eventCollector` and runs it after the outermost commit's `flush` (inline when
  unnested, discarded on rollback, and handed a ctx detached from the committed
  transaction). Every client write path registers its follow-up through it:
  `Create`/`CreateOrUpdate`/`GetOrCreate`/`Update` via `clientImpl.wakeAfterCommit`,
  `Delete` via `advanceGC`. This closes the `Added`-after-`Modified` inversion, the
  wake-for-a-rolled-back-row case, and the cascade-of-physical-deletes-inside-the-
  caller's-transaction case on `advanceGC`'s synchronous-collect branch. The one
  consequence it does *not* fix — a `created=true` returned from a transaction that
  later aborts — is inherent to nesting and stays documented in the `GetOrCreate`
  godoc and the README's *Writes* section.
